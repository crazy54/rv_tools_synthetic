# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on identifying, fixing, and validating the RVTools Synthetic Data Generator to ensure it works correctly and produces consistent, realistic data across all CSV files. The primary goal is to make the tool production-ready with proper data consistency and reliable ZIP packaging.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Issue Identification and Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the RVTools generator to run without errors, so that I can generate synthetic data reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script is executed with default parameters THEN it SHALL complete without Python errors or exceptions
2. WHEN the script encounters missing dependencies THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages with installation instructions
3. WHEN the script runs with AI features disabled THEN it SHALL fall back gracefully to mock data generation
4. WHEN the script processes YAML configuration files THEN it SHALL handle malformed YAML gracefully with meaningful error messages
5. WHEN the script generates CSV files THEN it SHALL create all expected CSV files without corruption

### Requirement 2: Data Consistency Validation

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want consistent data across all CSV files, so that the same infrastructure component has identical attributes wherever it appears.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a VM appears in multiple CSV files THEN it SHALL have the same VM Name, UUID, Host, Cluster, and Datacenter across all files
2. WHEN a host appears in multiple CSV files THEN it SHALL have the same Host Name, IP address, cluster assignment, and hardware specifications
3. WHEN a cluster appears in multiple CSV files THEN it SHALL have the same cluster name, datacenter, and configuration settings
4. WHEN a datastore appears in multiple CSV files THEN it SHALL have the same name, capacity, and host associations
5. WHEN network components appear in multiple CSV files THEN they SHALL maintain consistent VLAN IDs, switch assignments, and naming

### Requirement 3: ZIP Package Generation Validation

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the generated data packaged in a proper ZIP file, so that I can easily import it into tools that expect RVTools format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the generation process completes THEN it SHALL create a ZIP file in the specified output directory
2. WHEN the ZIP file is created THEN it SHALL contain all generated CSV files with proper RVTools naming conventions
3. WHEN the ZIP file is extracted THEN all CSV files SHALL be readable and properly formatted
4. WHEN multiple generation runs occur THEN each SHALL create uniquely named ZIP files with timestamps
5. WHEN the ZIP file is opened by RVTools-compatible software THEN it SHALL be recognized as a valid RVTools export

### Requirement 4: Cross-Reference Data Integrity

**User Story:** As a VMware administrator, I want realistic relationships between infrastructure components, so that the synthetic data accurately represents a real VMware environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VMs are assigned to hosts THEN the host SHALL have sufficient CPU and memory resources to support all assigned VMs
2. WHEN VMs use datastores THEN the datastore SHALL be accessible from the VM's assigned host
3. WHEN VMs connect to networks THEN the network SHALL be available on the VM's assigned host or cluster
4. WHEN clusters contain hosts THEN all hosts SHALL belong to the same datacenter as the cluster
5. WHEN resource pools are created THEN they SHALL belong to valid clusters with appropriate resource allocations

### Requirement 5: Testing and Validation Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests to validate the generator's functionality, so that I can ensure reliability across different configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are executed THEN they SHALL validate individual function correctness
2. WHEN integration tests are executed THEN they SHALL validate end-to-end generation workflows
3. WHEN data consistency tests are executed THEN they SHALL verify cross-CSV data integrity
4. WHEN performance tests are executed THEN they SHALL validate generation speed and resource usage
5. WHEN regression tests are executed THEN they SHALL ensure new changes don't break existing functionality
